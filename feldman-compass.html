    <h1>Privacy Policy for Feldman Compass</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 18/12/2025<br>
    <strong>Developer:</strong> Feldman</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Feldman (“we,” “our,” or “us”) operates the Feldman Compass mobile application (the “App”).
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. Feldman Compass is designed to function
        without collecting or storing personal data beyond what is strictly necessary for core
        functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Location Information</h3>
    <p>
        The App requests location access solely to determine device orientation and provide accurate
        compass functionality. Location data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is used only while the App is in use</li>
        <li>Is processed locally on your device</li>
        <li>Is not stored, transmitted, logged, or shared</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The App does not track your location in the background.
    </p>

    <h3>No Other Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
        Feldman Compass does not collect, store, or process:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identifiers (such as name, email address, or phone number)</li>
        <li>Account information (the App has no accounts or login system)</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Crash reports linked to individuals</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not display ads and does not integrate with any advertising networks or
        third-party ad services.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Feldman Compass does not use third-party services, SDKs, or analytics tools that collect
        data from users.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, share, or disclose user data to any third parties. Since no personal
        data is collected or stored, there is no data to share.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Because Feldman Compass does not collect or retain personal data, risks associated with
        data storage and breaches are minimized. All processing related to compass and location
        functionality occurs locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Feldman Compass does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or users
        of any age. The App is safe to use for all audiences.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy if the App’s functionality or data practices change.
        Any updates will be reflected by a revised effective date and made available with the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
        If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the App, you may contact
        the developer:
